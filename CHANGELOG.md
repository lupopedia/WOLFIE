# WOLFIE Orchestrator Changelog (Placeholder)

## NOTICES

- **2025-11-09** – Repository placeholder established at `0.0.1 (planning)`. Describes philosophy and versioning rules; no operational source code committed yet.
- **2025-11-17** – Updated README to clarify WOLFIE's role as AI version of Eric Gerdes, Agent ID 8 (∞), and core function of reading WOLFIE Headers to route tasks intelligently to other AI agents. WOLFIE is the only agent with a GitHub repository and serves as gateway for all agent interactions.

Formal entries will begin once LUPOPEDIA reaches its public `1.0.0` release and WOLFIE's orchestrator is cleared for publication.
