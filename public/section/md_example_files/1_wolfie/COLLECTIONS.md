## WHO
- **User**: Captain WOLFIE (Eric Robin Gerdes) - AI System Architect & Database Coordinator
- **Full Name**: Eric Robin Gerdes
- **Nickname**: WOLFIE
- **AI Assistant**: Claude (Cursor)
- **Projects**:
  - **LUPOPEDIA** - Ontology Knowledge Platform (web application)
  - **WOLFIE** - Documentation Header System (markdown organization)
  - Both named after Eric, both using The WOLFIE Way philosophy
- **Meaning**: People, agents, and entities involved in the projects

### Captain WOLFIE - The Solo Programmer
- **Title**: "Father of Live Help" - Pioneered real-time web communication
- **Background**: Solo creator of Crafty Syntax Live Help (2003-2025)
- **Achievement**: 1.2M+ downloads worldwide (500K SourceForge, 600K auto-installers)
- **Recognition**: Distributed alongside WordPress on major auto-installers (Softaculous, Installatron, Fantastico)
- **Years Active**: 20+ years (2003-2023), returned July 2025
- **Built With**: Notepad (no IDE, no frameworks, no AI assistance)
- **Current Pace**: 16 hours/day programming (as of 2025 return)

### The WOLFIE Way (Programming Philosophy)
- **First Principles**: Solves from fundamentals, not frameworks or trends
- **Fallback Philosophy**: "Always work, scale when possible" - graceful degradation across environments
- **Security First**: First question after 11-year hiatus: "Is this secure?" (not "will it work?")
- **The Unprimed Expert**: 11-year gap (2014-2025) created "fresh eyes" - missed React, Laravel, Docker, Node.js, TypeScript
- **Result**: Builds timeless architecture unconstrained by current trends

### Key Innovations That Power LUPOPEDIA and WOLFIE
- **Channel Architecture**: `onchannel` field - every conversation is unique integer ID (proven at 1.2M+ scale)
  - Used in: Crafty Syntax (2003), LUPOPEDIA (2025), WOLFIE Header System (2025)
- **saidto Routing**: Prevents "parrot effect" - controls who sees which message (critical for multi-agent AI)
  - Used in: Crafty Syntax live chat, LUPOPEDIA AI agent coordination
- **Cascade Fallback**: XMLHttpRequest → Buffer Flushing → Page Refresh (3-layer system, always works)
  - Used in: Crafty Syntax, LUPOPEDIA database abstraction (MySQL → PostgreSQL → fallback)
- **Central Definitions**: Single source of truth, reference over duplication
  - Used in: WOLFIE Header System (TAGS.md, COLLECTIONS.md), LUPOPEDIA (configuration files)

### Timeline
- **1996-2014**: Programming 10+ hours/day - built Crafty Syntax, government CRM, tourism platforms
- **2003**: Crafty Syntax first release (April 21, 2003) - pioneered channel architecture and saidto routing
- **2014**: Life change - goes from 10+ hours/day to minimal computer use
- **2023**: Crafty Syntax final release (November 7, 2023)
- **July 2025**: Returns to programming at 16 hours/day
- **July-October 2025**: Builds LUPOPEDIA (web platform) in 3 months using Internet Archive to recover old code
- **November 2025**: Creates WOLFIE Header System to organize 11,000+ documentation files

### Why This Matters for LUPOPEDIA and WOLFIE
- **Proven Architecture**: Channel + saidto system tested by 1.2M installations
- **Scalability**: Built for millions from day one
- **Longevity**: 22-year fallback philosophy still best practice today
- **Innovation**: Solving 2025 problems with patterns that worked in 2003
- **Solo Vision**: No committee, no compromise, pure innovation
- **Pattern Reuse**: Same architectural patterns work for web apps (LUPOPEDIA) and documentation (WOLFIE)
